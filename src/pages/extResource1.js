            UniCloud Africa, a company specializing in local cloud solutions,
            has partnered with Benue State, North Central Nigeria to construct a
            state-of-the-art data center and cloud ecosystem in Makurdi, the
            state capital.
            <br />
            <br />
            This agreement, signed in Abuja yesterday, will see UniCloud Africa
            provide the necessary cloud infrastructure for the data center.
            They’ll also partner with Africa Data Centres, a renowned
            pan-African operator, to establish a disaster recovery site in
            Abuja.
            <br />
            <br />
            Joining UniCloud Africa in this project are several other partners
            like Cedarview Communication Limited, which will be responsible for
            building the high-availability network infrastructure that will
            connect government institutions and other local entities within
            Benue State.
            <br />
            <br />
            The other partner is SIT Consulting, tasked with developing
            innovative software applications specifically designed to meet the
            needs of Benue’s users.
            <br />
            <br />
            This project is a significant step forward for Benue’s digital
            transformation. The in-country cloud solution offered by UniCloud
            Africa ensures that the state’s data remains within Nigeria’s
            borders.
            <br />
            <br />
            Speaking at the signing ceremony, Dr. Joy Smart Francis, Executive
            Director at UniCloud Africa, encouraged other states in Nigeria to
            follow Benue’s lead in promoting Nigeria’s digital economy.
            <br />
            <br />
            She highlighted the benefits of the project to include improved
            efficiency of Benue’s digital ecosystem, enhanced data security for
            the state government, creation of new technical skills and job
            opportunities for Benue youths and the potential to serve as a model
            for nationwide digitalization and data localization.
            <br />
            <br />
            According to the MOU, the project timeline and additional details
            are:

            <br />
            Responding, the Benue State Deputy Governor, His Excellency Dr.
            Barr. Sam Ode, expressed that this collaboration aligns perfectly
            with Governor Hyacinth Alia’s vision to develop the state’s ICT
            infrastructure and empower its youth. He believes this initiative
            has the potential to unlock a brighter future for Benue and its
            people.
            <br />
            <br />
            “We are delighted to be part of this initiative, which is capable of
